## 📅 Structure
Each day, I'll:
1. **Pick a problem**: From platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com), or [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com).
2. **Solve the problem**: Writing efficient, clean, and well-documented code.
3. **Reflect**: Summarize key takeaways, mistakes, and improvements.
4. **Push**: Commit the day's code and notes here.
